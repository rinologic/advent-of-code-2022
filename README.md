# Adevent of Code 2022
This year I decided to use write everything in TypeScript.

## Environment Setup
```
# npm install -g typescript
```

## Example Project Setup
```
$ mkdir day1
$ cd day1
$ npm init -y
$ npm install ts-node 
```
Note that ts-node should be usable globally, but I was getting an error with that setup, so I moved it to project level for now.
